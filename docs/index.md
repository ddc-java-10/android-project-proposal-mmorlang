## Summary

The purpose of this app is to help manage your time whether its to be used in a more relaxful, orgainized, purposeful or productive way, by the limitation of screen time distractions.

## Intended users


- Individuals who have limited time and want to prioritize their time so that they can be as prodictive as possible.

> Sometimes it can be hard for me to focus on a current task and give it my full attention so this app will help me be free of notification distractions during that time of concentration.


- Individual who can get caught up in technology and want to be able to set aside time distraction free.


>With alot of things being technology based I would like to use this app to get from screen time by turning off the notifications thus limiting the distractions to enjoy other aspects of life.

## Stretch goals/possible enhancements 

My stretch goal will be to explore the possibility of connecting to SMS and calling aspects of the phone that would generate a automatic response when you have certain times scheduled. Another would be an option you can set would be that certain keywords can be entered in case of emergencies to allow a notificaion through.
