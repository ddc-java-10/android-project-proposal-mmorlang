## Summary

The purpose of this app is to help manage your time whether its in a more relaxful, orgainized, purposeful or productive way. By the limitation of screen time distractions.

## Intended users



> As a Individual who has limited time I want to prioritize my time so that I can be as prodictive as possible.
Sometimes it can be hard for me to focus on a current task and give it my full attention so this app will help me be free of notification distractions.


> As a Individual who can get caught up in technology I want to be able to set aside time discration free.
With alot of things being technology based I would like to use this app to get from screen time by turning off the notifications thus limiting the distractions

## Stretch goals/possible enhancements 

My stretch goal will be to explore the possibility of connecting to SMS and calling portions of the phone and generating an automatic response. Another would be an option you can set would be that certain keywords can be entered on the side opposite of the user in case of emergencies to allow a notificaion through.
